MCP uses JSON-RPC to encode messages. JSON-RPC messages **MUST** be UTF-8 encoded.

The protocol currently defines two standard transport mechanisms for client-server
communication:

1. [stdio](#stdio), communication over standard in and standard out
2. [Streamable HTTP](#streamable-http)

Clients **SHOULD** support stdio whenever possible.

It is also possible for clients and servers to implement
[custom transports](#custom-transports) in a pluggable fashion.

## stdio

In the **stdio** transport:

- The client launches the MCP server as a subprocess.
- The server reads JSON-RPC messages from its standard input (`stdin`) and sends messages
  to its standard output (`stdout`).
- Messages are individual JSON-RPC requests, notifications, or responses.
- Messages are delimited by newlines, and **MUST NOT** contain embedded newlines.
- The server **MAY** write UTF-8 strings to its standard error (`stderr`) for any
  logging purposes including informational, debug, and error messages.
- The client **MAY** capture, forward, or ignore the server's `stderr` output
  and **SHOULD NOT** assume `stderr` output indicates error conditions.
- The server **MUST NOT** write anything to its `stdout` that is not a valid MCP message.
- The client **MUST NOT** write anything to the server's `stdin` that is not a valid MCP
  message.

## Streamable HTTP

In the **Streamable HTTP** transport, the server operates as an independent process that
can handle multiple client connections. This transport uses HTTP POST and GET requests.
Server can optionally make use of
[Server-Sent Events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events) (SSE) to stream
multiple server messages. This permits basic MCP servers, as well as more feature-rich
servers supporting streaming and server-to-client notifications and requests.

The server **MUST** provide a single HTTP endpoint path (hereafter referred to as the
**MCP endpoint**) that supports both POST and GET methods. For example, this could be a
URL like `https://example.com/mcp`.

### Security Warning

When implementing Streamable HTTP transport:

1. Servers **MUST** validate the `Origin` header on all incoming connections to prevent DNS rebinding attacks
   - If the `Origin` header is present and invalid, servers **MUST** respond with HTTP 403 Forbidden. The HTTP response
     body **MAY** comprise a JSON-RPC _error response_ that has no `id`
2. When running locally, servers **SHOULD** bind only to localhost (127.0.0.1) rather than all network interfaces (0.0.0.0)
3. Servers **SHOULD** implement proper authentication for all connections

Without these protections, attackers could use DNS rebinding to interact with local MCP servers from remote websites.
