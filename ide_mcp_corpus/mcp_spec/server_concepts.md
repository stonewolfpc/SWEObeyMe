MCP servers are programs that expose specific capabilities to AI applications through standardized protocol interfaces.

Common examples include file system servers for document access, database servers for data queries, GitHub servers for code management, Slack servers for team communication, and calendar servers for scheduling.

## Core Server Features

Servers provide functionality through three building blocks:

| Feature       | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                             | Examples                                                           | Who controls it |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| **Tools**     | Functions that your LLM can actively call, and decides when to use them based on user requests. Tools can write to databases, call external APIs, modify files, or trigger other logic. | Search flights<br />Send messages<br />Create calendar events      | Model           |
| **Resources** | Passive data sources that provide read-only access to information for context, such as file contents, database schemas, or API documentation.                                           | Retrieve documents<br />Access knowledge bases<br />Read calendars | Application     |
| **Prompts**   | Pre-built instruction templates that tell the model to work with specific tools and resources.                                                                                          | Plan a vacation<br />Summarize my meetings<br />Draft an email     | User            |

We will use a hypothetical scenario to demonstrate the role of each of these features, and show how they can work together.
